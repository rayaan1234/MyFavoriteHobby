        <p >Amongst all the outdoor games, cricket is my favourite and I love to play this game. It is my favorite hobby. Cricket is the most watched sport in India and people have an emotional connect towards it. This sport is played by using a bat and a ball between two teams of 11 members each. Every team has its own set of batsmen, bowlers, fielders and a wicket-keeper. The team which wins the toss gets to decide whether it will bat or field first. The team with the highest score wins. There are many rules and regulations in cricket, which make it more interesting. My favourite cricketer is Virat Kohli and I love the way he plays the game and leads the entire team.</p>
